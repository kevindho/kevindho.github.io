                <h1>User Research</h1>
                <p class="subheading"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K7C2vPHPp2SxEx-3oWWxy7YYTXD7Qe_WxQVrPqAq0eo">User Interview</a></p>
                <p class="finalContent">User interviews were an important part of my research because it gives me different perspectives about how to build my website. My interviews were mainly students. However every student had a different background knowledge and goals. Even though not all students had a background in computers they were still able to give important input as to what they would look for in a person's portfolio. The interviews gave me ideas about what I should and should not include as part of my website. </p>
                
                <p class="subheading"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HVCT-0VwoMY_wS7e4HZdH6r4wbfmGW6XZV5ShjZPbHw">Competitor Analysis</a></p>
                <p class="finalContent">Competitor analysis is used to compare my own websites strengths and weaknesses in relation to another person's portfolio. However, I did not compare my website to any real competitors. I compared my website to fellow students and professional portfolios. From these comparisons I was able to see new possible features I could add to my own website as well as where my website falls short. </p>
                
                <p class="subheading"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AYM3p20nm5TgAhFjP651wjuaOYOPXYdZ9YMn3ETgQkk">Feature Value Matrix</a></p>
                <p class="finalContent">Feature value matrices calculate a features worth based on user value, business value, and development effort. For my own website, I wanted to keep my features simple and doable. I did not want to make complicated unnecessary features that would be hard to build. My main focuses were to make an easy to navigate website where users did not have a problem accessing its content. If certain features scored a high number, I would leave that feature for last or omit it altogether. </p>
                
                <p class="subheading"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZhBRr9KTgl84AuWHhYPJQn4HfSNczmsbRnPA5p3M4cM">Feature Prioritization</a></p>
                <p class="finalContent">My feature prioritization is directly related to my feature value matrix scores. Since I valued easy navigation and accessibility, the navigation bar was one my first priorities because it allowed for quick links to different pages. Another priority was making it mobile friendly because most people access web content on their mobile devices nowadays. While navigation was a priority, scroll arrows was last on my priority list because the navigation bar was already an easy form of navigation and the scroll arrows were more difficult to implement. </p>
                
                <h1>User Testing</h1>
                <p class="subheading"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=140AmGdc8WrKmc8Q6TEfVaO-_3jv0XtHDGlfhlG_DbX8">User Stories</a></p>
                <p class="finalContent">User stories were used to think about different ways different types of people would use the features on my website. For example, a hiring manager may want to find my resume quickly or even a client may want to find my contact information to talk about a possible project These user stories gave me an idea of which user I wanted to target and which features they might need for the website to fulfill its purpose.</p>
                
                <p class="subheading"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=12JRG7xHDZawPhiJJl8RiDnsHmNFV_n91ZKHkdvkHVyc">Cognitive Walkthrough</a></p>
                <p class="finalContent">Cognitive walkthroughs allowed me to personally watch users access content on my website. I guided them through my website to perform various tasks to see how easy or difficult it was for the user to perform the given task. If a task was too difficult, it allowed to me to see how I could potentially fix the issue. I was also able to ask the users what were the strengths and weaknesses of my website as well as what other things they felt I should include.</p>
                
                <p class="subheading">User Tests</p>
                <p class="finalContent">The two user tests I conducted were the Click Test and the Question Test. I conducted the click test because easy navigation was one of the more important features on my website. I wanted to be able to see what a user's first instinct is when they are given a specific task. I used the Question test because it allowed to me ask questions about specific content on my website. I wanted to make sure the website fulfilled one of its purposes, which is to be able to put me in contact with intended audiences.<br><br>
                    <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/c56b40c5cf/results/13462ba0b8bb">Click Test Results</a><br>
                    <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/ebb32bd770e/results/ee1bb8294e88">Question Test Results</a></p>

                <h1>Summary of Finding</h1>
                <p class="finalContent">After doing user research and testing, I have discovered that my website still needs a lot of work. Some of the complaints are that my website is rather plain and empty. Others stated that the colors were boring and the website was not pretty to look at. One of the things users looked for was a resume which I failed to include.</p>
                <p class="finalContent"> Even though there were many things to improve on. I learned that I did do some things right. For example, my website was easy to navigate. Users were able to access my content quickly and easily. My website was also responsive to mobile screen resolutions. I also included many ways for users to contact me.</p>
                
                <h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
                <p class="finalContent">Through my user research and testing, I have come up with potential changes to my website. One of the first changes is to include a resume section to my website. This is one of the features that users asked for. With this incorporation I may decide to put my website into a whole new direction such as something more professional and traditional. This would allow me to add more content in such as past and current projects.</p>
                <p class="finalContent">Another change I could potentially implement is the colors of my website. At the moment, my website is not attractive to the eye even though content is stil perfectly readable. Since the website is a reflection of myself, if the website is poorly made/designed it would reflect my own personal skills. These are some of the potential changes I could make to my website after conducting my research and tests. </p>
